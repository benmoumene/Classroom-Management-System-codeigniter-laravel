To create an instructor account and course, just go to [queso.cc/register/instructor](http://queso.cc/register/instructor)\r\n\r\n### Host It Yourself?\r\nIf you're the type of person that likes having everything on your own server, just download the files and stick it on your server.  Queso is built with Laravel, so you should migrate the tables to setup the MySQL database.  In the future, there will be better documentation for this.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAre you a developer looking to get involved with Queso?
